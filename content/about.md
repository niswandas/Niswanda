### Hello, I'm Agung **Niswanda.**

Currently I am a 9 to 5 employee, working as a CSR at **Telkomsel** (the largest telecommunications company in Indonesia) makes me very familiar with the world of technology in particular.

Through this blog I will share a lot of information related to everything I have learned starting from the **latest technology, running, hiking, SEO**, etc.

This blog is also my **side project** which I hope the information in it can be useful at least for the people closest to me.

**Fun Fact**: If you are a tourist, I can be youre Guide in Indonesia 👋🏽
