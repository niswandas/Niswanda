Planning a trip to Indonesia in 2025? From Bali’s jungles to Jakarta’s culture and Lombok’s beaches, staying connected is key for a smooth travel experience. A reliable SIM card is essential for navigating, sharing adventures, and staying in touch. 

But with so many options, how do you choose the best SIM card for tourists in Indonesia? This guide covers everything you need to know about finding the best SIM card for 2025, including coverage, data plans, where to buy, and money-saving tips. 

In this article i will covers some of simcard option that available in Indonesia, but i will more talk about one specific simcard; **Telkomsel**. Why? because i already use this simcard for over five years and maybe this could be a bias for some people. Let’s dive in!

## Why You Need a SIM Card in Indonesia as a Tourist

You might be wondering, *"Do I really need a SIM card in Indonesia?"* The answer is a resounding **yes**! Indonesia is a vast archipelago with over 17,000 islands, and while Wi-Fi is available in many hotels and cafes, it’s often slow, unreliable, or restricted to specific areas. 

A local SIM card ensures you have **fast, affordable, and uninterrupted internet access** wherever you go. From using Google Maps to find **hidden gems**, translating Bahasa Indonesia, to booking last-minute tours or rideshares, a SIM card is your ultimate travel companion. 

Plus, with competitive data plans and prices, staying connected in Indonesia has never been easier or more budget-friendly. Let’s explore why a SIM card is a non-negotiable for your 2025 Indonesian adventure!

## Top 3 SIM Cards for Tourists in Indonesia (2025)

1. **TELKOMSEL**

I will write this section based on my personal experience as a user and as a employee when i working in **Telkomsel.** This might sound **biased**, but I can also provide accurate information since I worked at this company.

If you search on Google for "The Best Simcard in Indonesia," I can guarantee that Telkomsel will appear at the top. This is because Telkomsel remains the most popular choice not only for Indonesian citizens but also for tourists visiting Indonesia.

Besides its affordable prices, for tourists who are visiting temporarily, you can register your phone's IMEI at GraPARI (Telkomsel's Customer Service Center).

Just bring your passport and the phone you plan to use, and you'll be able to get a temporary IMEI registration and a prepaid simcard which I'm confident will be sufficient to cover your usage while vacationing in Indonesia.

With **Telkomsel's** advantage of being able to register your phone's IMEI, this will be an added value for those who are only visiting for a short time. You no longer need to register your IMEI at the Airport or Customs where you would have to pay a fee for IMEI registration while at Telkomsel stores (GraPARI) it's **free**.

### **2. XL**

XL provides reliable coverage in major tourist areas including Bali, Jakarta, and Yogyakarta. The network supports basic functions like maps, social media, and streaming without interruption.

The signal becomes weaker in remote areas such as Flores and smaller islands. For travelers focused on main cities and tourist destinations, XL delivers consistent performance.

Top-ups are relatively easy, as they don’t differ much from other providers. You might notice differences in prices and benefits for the internet packages you want to purchase.

Compared to other providers, this one is only suitable if you’re visiting Indonesia for less than 10 days. However, keep in mind that XL customer service outlets do not offer IMEI registration, unlike Telkomsel.

### **3. SMARTFREN**

If you’re a budget traveler or a short-term visitor, this provider might be your first choice. Why? Because it offers affordable internet packages.

Unlike Telkomsel or XL, Smartfren does not require IMEI registration for foreign phones—a significant advantage for short-term visitors. However, where there are advantages, there are also drawbacks. The signal provided by this provider is not as good as competitors like Telkomsel and XL.

If your budget is tight and you don’t often visit crowded areas, this is the best option in my opinion. However, do not rely on this provider if you plan to go to remote locations or very crowded places like Jakarta, Bali, Yogyakarta, etc.

From the explanation above, you should now be able to decide on your preferred provider, considering factors like signal and coverage, as well as the ease of using the SIM card.
## Where to Buy a SIM Card in Indonesia

I will always update the list of places (GraPARI) where you can get a Telkomsel SIM card.

Currently, I am based in Semarang, Central Java. If you visit Semarang, you can search for “GraPARI Semarang Pahlawan” on Google Maps. It is located in the city center, and the building is very easy to find.

> A little tips from me, **if you are a tourist** and you planning to travel to **Java Island** and **Bali.** Just go to GrapARI at java island (e.g., Semarang).  You’ll thank me later.
